# ConnectAuto
This Bot, allows to send "connect" automatically to all your relationships of 
degree 2 or more (you must modify the link of the variable 'link'). 
You must also define your variable path from Chrome and the driver chrome 
(note that I am actually using version 93 of chrome, but you will be replacing 
it with your current version of chrome.)
You can find your actual version of the Browser on `chrome:://version`
You also need to define Your default user path, 
 it is not recommended to use your default chrome profile. You can create a new profile,and put the variable
path on main.py.
Install selenium with pip3 (IDE Pycharm is very recommended !) :
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

~~_TO DO~~_
When the bot goes to page 2, there is a stupid error, 
this element can't be reachable. I know this is a silly mistake but I 
failed to fix it, probably the selenium doc should help you out. 

**PS : I'm not responsible for what you're doing, it's a simple BOT for education. Be careful.
**And that's all. Enjoy Guys !****
