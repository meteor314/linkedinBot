# ConnectAuto
With thi BOt you can simply connect send a connect Button Two all your second third or anyone else you want. 
You just need to change the variable named "link". 
You also need to define your variable path from Chrome and the chromedriver 
(note that I actually use version 93 of chrome, but you will replace with your actual version of chrome.)


You can find your actual version of the Browser on `chrome:://version`
You also need to define Your default user path, 
I didn't  recommend you to use your default chrome profile. You can create a new profile,and put the variable
path on main.py.
Install selenium with pip3 (IDE Pycharm is very recommended !) :
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


**PS : I'm not responsible for what you're doing, it's a simple BOT for education. Be careful.
**And that's all. Enjoy Guys !****
